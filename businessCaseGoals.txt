Example problems scenario:

Oliva Orchids resells fruits from different sources either as their own product (I.E. Olivia sells amy's apple from Amy Apple Shop) or 
product bundled together (I.E. Olivia Apple basket #1 includes Amy's apples, Adam's apples, etc). 

Olivia will also need to prep certain products or leave as is (I.E. Olivia needs bags for Apple basket #1 or to wash Amy's apple)

Olivia will need to determine which product is more profitable (Olivia's basket #1 vs Amy's apple)

Olivia needs to keep track of how many products incoming (I.E. How many apples did she buy from Amy? Adam?)

Olivia needs to keep track how many products she currently has and are finished 
(I.E. How many apples did she actually recieve from Amy? Which apples are cleaned and ready to be delivered? unclean?)

Olivia workers need to know what group of products they should work on 
(Olivia's workers must work on all apple since Applefest is coming up)

Olivia workers need to know what to do with a product (Should they clean amy's apple or set aside for Olivia's basket?)

Olivia needs to know how many products are being shipped out and to where (How many amy's apple did she sell to Mr. Applelove?)

3 workers
